### Four Sum

> No.18, medium

Given an array S of n integers, are there elements a, b, c, and d in S such that a + b + c + d = target? Find all unique quadruplets in the array which gives the sum of target.

Note: The solution set must not contain duplicate quadruplets.

```
For example, given array S = [1, 0, -1, 0, -2, 2], and target = 0.

A solution set is:
[
  [-1,  0, 0, 1],
  [-2, -1, 1, 2],
  [-2,  0, 0, 2]
]
```

#### 分析

题目要求在给定的一维数组集合中找出 4 个数，这 4 个数之和必须等于 target，找出所有满足条件且不重复的组合。

#### Four Sum II

> No.454, medium

Given four lists A, B, C, D of integer values, compute how many tuples `(i, j, k, l)` there are such that `A[i] + B[j] + C[k] + D[l]` is zero.

To make problem a bit easier, all A, B, C, D have same length of N where 0 ≤ N ≤ 500. All integers are in the range of -2^28 to 2^28 - 1 and the result is guaranteed to be at most 2^31 - 1.

Example:

```text
Input:
A = [ 1, 2]
B = [-2,-1]
C = [-1, 2]
D = [ 0, 2]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The two tuples are:
1. (0, 0, 0, 1) -> A[0] + B[0] + C[0] + D[1] = 1 + (-2) + (-1) + 2 = 0
2. (1, 1, 0, 0) -> A[1] + B[1] + C[0] + D[0] = 2 + (-1) + (-1) + 0 = 0
```
